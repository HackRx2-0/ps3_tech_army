## What is investAR ?
##### Our solution aims to educate users about different financial products using Augmented Reality. It would channel the abundant information for different products and present them in an immersive way.

## Inspiration 
##### There are two major problems, that new customers generally face:
<ul>
  <li>Getting overwhelmed by the overflow of information and then choosing the right product.</li>
  <li>Putting trust in the product to invest my hard earned money.</li>
</ul>

##### Focussing on the former points, we decided to build <b>“InvestAR”</b>, your guide to investment.

## Problem it solves:
##### Our solution aims to educate users about different financial products using Augmented Reality. It would channel the abundant information for different products and present them in an immersive way. Users can explore various products and then play some mini games regarding that to earn some virtual money. We plan to simulate real world usage of financial services offered by Bajaj finserv Markets, as this would help them understand the product better and would help in gaining their trust. Users can earn money by playing mini games and then invest in Bajaj products virtually. Let's say for example, I earned 100 virtual coins by playing a quiz and from there I invested in digital gold using that virtual money. 
##### As the user will start progressing in the game, they will gain experience which would earn them tiers, better ranking, achievements and badges. Users can share their AR game profile on social media which would increase our brand awareness and the solution itself will increase user retention and recall.
##### Ultimately, the users would be playing quiz to maintain their virtual portfolio and invest in it using virtual money.
##### Moreover, Our solution can be expanded to an independent framework that can be easily imported into the site/application without creating any security flaws
